Hi There,

This repository is for following tasks in Alexa Development:

1. Convert a large dataset file with text docs and split them into onle line per text file
2. After splitting, remove the special cahracters using regex in python
3. Further on removal of special chars, the text is converted to Audio MP3 file using gTTS
4. The files when converted to mp3 are then converted to Alexa friendly audio files
5. Cheers!!

This may help in Alexa development
